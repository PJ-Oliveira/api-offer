Feature: Cucumber testing step definitions

  Scenario: My Java mentor wants me to test with Cucumber, so: below I test each method of my Controller with a brief history.
    Given That, well, I can list all offer
    Then I can search for a another offer
    And I can create a newly offer too
    Then If I want to, I can create and I can delete a offer as well

  Scenario: A little more of tests
    Given that I can perform authentication
    And I can create an inactive offer and make it active
    Then Sometimes I wonder if that specific offer still exists
